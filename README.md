I am Danilo Albuquerque. I am 21 years old. I'm a information security enthusiastic and developer during my free time. I love to learn new things, to test, to help, to be helped, and, of course, to contribute to our big community! I know how to develop applications using Java, Angular, Python (today I am learning a little bit more about its frameworks, such as Django and Flask).
